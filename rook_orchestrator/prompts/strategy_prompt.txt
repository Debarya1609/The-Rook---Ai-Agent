USER:
You will be given a board_state and insights between markers below.
===BOARD_START===
{board_state_here}
===BOARD_END===
===INSIGHTS_START===
{insights_here}
===INSIGHTS_END===

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Output valid JSON only. No surrounding text, no code fences.
2. If you detect an urgent risk (e.g., high_cpa), include an appropriate action (example: adjust_budget).
3. Keep actions <= 7. Use conservative business logic.
4. When uncertain, set confidence to 0.4–0.5 and include a clear reason.
5. Use short strings for reason/summary. Always include details as an object even if empty ({}).

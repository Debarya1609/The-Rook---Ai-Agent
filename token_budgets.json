A sudden drop in CTR immediately after a creative change points directly to the creative itself not resonating with the audience.\n*   **Impact:** Lower CTR means fewer clicks for the same number of impressions. This typically leads to:\n    *   Higher CPMs (Cost Per Mille/1000 impressions) because Facebook's algorithm penalizes ads with low engagement.\n    *   Higher CPCs (Cost Per Click).\n    *   Ultimately, a much higher CPA, as seen ($18.0 vs $10.0 target).\n*   **Campaign Conte",
